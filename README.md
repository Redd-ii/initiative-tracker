# RPG Initiative Tracker
This project was for me and my friends to track health and initiative more intuitively as we played Dungeons and Dragons. This can be used for numurous RPG Tabletop games. There is functionality to both export and import player data to save current players stats.
planning on making this into a bigger project.
